		<h1>Primitive Data Types</h1>
		<p>There are several types of data used in JavaScript that serve as the basic building blocks of every program. These are called primitive data types and consists of the following types: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>String</li>
			<li>Number</li>
			<li>Boolean</li>
			<li>Null*</li>
			<li>Undefined*</li>
		</ul>
		<h6>*These data types are weird.</h6>
		<p>Any expression in JavaScript will return a value (e.g. 2 + 2 return 4), and that value will have a type. For example, the result of 2 + 2 is 4 and 4's data type is a number. If you add 2 + "2", the result is "22", and "22" is a string.</p>
		<strong>A value's type, tells us what kind of "thing" it is.</strong>
